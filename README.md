# Up and Running with AngularJS


## Installation

To get this server up and running, do the following:

* Install [Node](http://nodejs.org)
* Install **Express** as node dependency
* Type `npm install` the first time to get the server's dependencies
* Type `node index.js` to start the server
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The port number can be changed in `index.js` if necessary
* Directory structure might need some changes such as '\' instead of '/' in case of Windows
* Linux should work just fine without any changes
